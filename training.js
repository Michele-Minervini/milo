   Milo — training logic.

   Turns the log into what the four tabs show: calendar weeks,
   hard sets per muscle group, the weekly target for each group
   and how far along it is (Today's bars, the Body radar and its
   cards), the pace an even week needs by today and Body's
   sentence built on it, "this point last week", the week strip
   and the month calendar with their group dots, workouts and the
   week streak (History), what counted for a group this week,
   which skills feed it, and the one nudge. And the gym: the
   exercises (the catalogue plus your own), which sets were
   warm-ups, e1RM, one exercise's history and best set, and the
   double-progression suggestion for its next session. Data only:
   the words the app shows are app.js's.

   Pure functions over plain values: no DOM, no storage, and no
   clock — whoever needs "this week" passes the time in — so
   tests/training-test.js runs them in Node. Every function takes
   any log (sanitized v5 entries of every kind, an empty log, or
   junk) without throwing.

   ONE piece of module state: the exercises registered with
   useExercises(state.exercises) — custom exercises and tweaks to
   built-in ones. Every gym lookup (exercise(), and through it what a
   gym entry counts for) reads it. The app calls useExercises()
   whenever its state changes; until then only the built-in
   exercises exist. Tests that register exercises must call it, and
   call useExercises([]) when they are done.

   Reads the tables in data.js (AREAS, GROUP_INFO, AREA_GROUPS,
   VARIATION_GROUPS, QUICK_GROUPS, GYM_EXERCISES) and the
   calendar-day helpers and sanitizeExercise in model.js, so it
   loads after both and before app.js.

   Dates: a week is Monday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59, local time. A
   day is the calendar day of an entry's ts (MODEL.dateStr), never
   its stored `date`. Days are stepped with MODEL.startOfDay /
   addDays and counted with dayDelta only — never by adding
   86400000 ms, which goes wrong in daylight-saving weeks (they
   are 167 or 169 hours long). Months are moved by the calendar
   (new Date(year, month + n, 1)), then days by addDays.

   Numbers: every weight is 1, ½ or ¼, so weekly totals are exact
   multiples of ¼ (floating point adds those without error). Zones
   are decided on the exact total; fmtSets() shows it as "9¾".
   Stored kg are multiples of 0.25 too, so the warm-up test and the
   suggestions compare exact values (see score()).
