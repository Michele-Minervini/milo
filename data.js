   shoulders, arms, abs, legs. Weekly volume is counted in HARD SETS:
   working sets taken close to failure. Warm-ups don't count.

   A weight map says what ONE hard set counts for, per group:
     1     the group the exercise is mainly for (never more than one)
     0.5   a group that helps ("indirect work counts half")
   A group that isn't listed gets nothing. {} counts for nothing at
   all (mobility work). A map may have no 1 at all: a movement too
   light to be a full set for anything still gives ½ to what it works.
   training.js multiplies these by the sets logged and adds them up.

   The gym catalogue — the built-in exercises of the gym sheet.

   `id` IS PERMANENT. Every gym log entry stores it (exId), and so
   does every tweak someone makes to a built-in exercise
   (state.exercises), on every device and in every backup, for
   good. Never rename, reuse or remove an id: the old entries would
   stay, but nothing would know what they were. Names, rep ranges,
   steps and groups can be fixed freely — they are read from here
   each time. tests/data-test.js keeps a frozen list of the ids, so
   a changed one fails there first.
   Ids are lowercase snake_case: the movement, then the equipment
   when the movement is done with more than one (bench_bb,
   bench_db). "x_" ids are reserved for custom exercises.

     name     what the picker and the gym sheet show
     p        the group one hard set counts 1 for
     s        groups it also counts ½ for (0–3, in MODEL.GROUPS
              order). Kept conservative, only helpers that clearly
              work hard: presses give ½ to shoulders and arms, pulls
              ½ to arms; squats and isolation work give nothing.

              10–20, the ab wheel 8–15, the plank 20–60 s
